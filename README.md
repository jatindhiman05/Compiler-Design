## Index

| S.No. | Name of Practical/Program | Go |
|--------|----------------------------|---------|
| 1 | To generate and analyze the intermediate files generated during the compilation of a C/C++ program. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/tree/master/Lab%201) |
| 2 | To develop a lexical analyzer in C++ that reads a C++ source file and identifies reserved keywords, variables, numbers, and operators. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/tree/master/Lab%202) |
| 3 | Implementation of lexical analysis through regex library. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/tree/master/Lab%203) |
| 4 | To understand the working of the Lex tool for lexical analysis by implementing various programs. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/tree/master/Lab%204) |
| 5 | To implement Thompson's construction algorithm for converting a regular expression into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/blob/master/Lab%205/RegexToNfa.cpp) |
| 6 | To implement a recursive descent parser for validating arithmetic expressions using context-free grammar. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/blob/master/Lab%206/recursiveDescentParser.cpp) |
| 7 | To compute the First and Follow sets of a given grammar using a C++ program. | [Go](https://github.com/jatindhiman05/Compiler-Design/blob/master/Lab%206/firstFollow.cpp) |
